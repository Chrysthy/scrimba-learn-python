# Challenge: Track the Score
# Tell the player their score and how they did!
# 1. Before the loop, set up a `score` variable to count correct guesses. Initalize to 0.
# 2. Each time the player guesses correctly, increment the score by one.
# 3. Once the game ends, show a final score out of the total rounds. Example: "Final score: 3/5"
# 4. Use an if/elif/else chain to give fun feedback based on their score. Here's an example output, but feel free to write your own:
#    A score of 5: "Flawless! All tests passing, zero bugs."
#    A score of 4: "Near perfect, only one failing test!"
#    A score of 3: "Good effort! The code runs, and that's what counts."
#    A score under 3: "Have you tried turning it off and on again?"
